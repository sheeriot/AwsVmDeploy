# AWS VM Deploy - DocSet

## GitHub Prep

### On GitHub Environments

Public GitHub repos and paid-for private repos can use Environments.

Free and private repo do not support Environments, but you need the workflow to accept the ENV_NAME as a Variable name, as it cannot be inherited from the environment.

### Setup each GitHub Environment

Access the repository Settings page to setup each environment variable and secret.
